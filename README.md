## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   N/A

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I am very interested about the conventional ways that multiple pages of a website are stored. I know that there are many different possibilities, but would love to hear the opinions and recommendations of top web developers and experts.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would probably change the game type completely into a trivia type game about a subject I am interested in. Example: NFL Trivia Quiz. It would be a smaller part of a bigger site that has a lot of differnet ways to teach people about a certain topic. There will be a list-style studying, index card style studying, minigames to make studying a little more fun, etc. I want to take all the knowledge I will learn from web development and be able to create any sort of website for any type of reason (specifically, for a business or organization).
